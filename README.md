# Text Classification via Topological Data Analysis
This repository is a supplement to my master's thesis, "Text Classification via Topological Data Analysis", written during the spring of 2023 at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).

The folder  ``datasets`` contains datasets with the preprocessed and lemmatized human-written and machine-generated texts that were used in the experiments of the thesis.

The original texts in  ``essays.csv`` were obtained from https://github.com/rexshijaku/chatgpt-generated-text-detection-corpus.

The original texts in  ``webtext.csv`` and files with names starting with "gpt2" were obtained from https://github.com/openai/gpt-2-output-dataset.
